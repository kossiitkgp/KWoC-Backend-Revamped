# Module structure

```
├── cmd
│   └── backend.go
│   └── ...
├── controllers
│   └── index.go
│   └── ...
├── server
│   ├── router.go
│   └── routes.go
│   └── ...
└── utils
    └── logger.go
    └── ...
```

`cmd` : contains the entrypoint of the backend (main package)

`controllers` : handler functions for the routes defined

`server` : contains the router logic and routes 

`utils` : contains misc functions like logger

> For new packages, a few suggestions

- For middlewares, please create and use `middleware` directory
- If there are any css,html or other static files, use `static` directory
- Do not keep many functions in utils, if they can be grouped in a package, then do so.
